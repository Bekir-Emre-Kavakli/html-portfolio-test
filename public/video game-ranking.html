<h1>The Best Video Games According to Emre</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Video Games of All Time:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Baldur's Gate 3</h3>

<p>A recent entry and an iconic follow up to one of the greatiest CRPG Franchise of all time. High quality visuals, cinematics, voice acting, RPG mechanics, companions and so on.</p>


<h3>Fallout: New Vegas</h3>

<p>This one is how a Bethesda-created Fallout should be, well, thanks to Obsidian Entertainments. If you are not really into isometric and turn-based CRPGs like Baldur's Gate 3, you should give this one a chance. Smartly established dialogue options to blend the world around the player as they wish. Also includes compatible and high quality mod support.</p>


<h3>Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</h3>

<p>This edition perfectly blends all the Expansion packs available for the game. It's a soulslike, you surely heard of before. Where you die a lot and try it over and over again to achieve success and the feeling of satisfaction is extraordinary. TPS game where it allows players to change and try lots of combinations of various playstyles and builds. Also, there is a good and detailed lore for those who are interested.</pp>
